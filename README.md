# Standard-ML-Functional-Programming-Computer-Science-Project

This repository contains an implementation of efficient and scalable functional programming techniques using the Standard ML language. The project focuses on the use of recursive logic to create code that is both elegant and efficient for use in financial applications, including market trading. By leveraging these techniques, the code is able to handle complex financial calculations with speed and accuracy, making it an ideal solution for use in real-world financial applications.
